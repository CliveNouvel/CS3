				<h1>What is a mood?</h1>
				<p>A mood is a temporary feeling you get randomly throughout the day. Your mood can change due to external factors such as music. With the right songs your mood can change from sad to happy and even vice versa </p>
				<p> Here are the things that you should expect from every song you'll get </p>

					<p> Being happy means a lot of things but it certainly means there's a smile to your face. You know what they say </p>

					<p> There are times when we don't know what we're feeling. There are also times where our mood changes due to a trivial thing </p>
